As a student in a different country I learned a lot of tips to find the perfect place to live, unfortunately, everything I learned was at the final period of my studies.\n\nBarcelona is a modern cosmopolitan city endowed with great dynamism. A great place with a rich culture, an identity of its own and an inexhaustible cultural and recreational offer. Therefore, it is not surprising that it is the 3rd most visited city in Europe and the 10th worldwide, with more than 8.4 million tourists annually. But all of this has a cost: it is the city with the most expensive rental in Spain. Also, in Barcelona there are more than 200,000 students where the 40% are foreign and the other 30% comes from other cities of Spain. We have the combination of a city with a lot of attractions and culture and a high flow of students desperate to find the most convenient place to live.\n\nMy business idea is to create an application that recommends the best neighborhood to live in Barcelona according to each type of student. Let's take a look."
