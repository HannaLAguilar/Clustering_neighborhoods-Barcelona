# The quest for the perfect Neighbourhood

This is the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Project overview

Using a combination of coordinates of the neighborhoods, location date like restaurants, cinemas, clubs, and Machine Learning, I grouped neighborhoods into 5 cluster like the image. 

#### Technologies used in this project:
* Python
* pandas, numpy
* sklearn, cluster kmeans
* matplotlib, seaborn, folium
* jupyter notebooks, anaconda

## Data

In order to build the cluster model, the following data was needed:

- Cartographic division of Barcelona by neighborhood
- The most attractive places for each neighborhood
- Libraries 
- Cost of the average rental of apartments by neighborhood
- Transport information

The sources used for this project are:

- **Foursquare**: to get the venue data from the neighbourhoods
- **Open Data BCN**: to get information about:
    - Population
    - Coordinates of the neighbourhoods
    - Apartment rental by neighborhood 
    - Public libraries 
    - Public transportation


The sources used for this project are Foursquare and [Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/es/).
