# The quest for the perfect Neighbourhood

This is the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Project overview

Barcelona is a modern cosmopolitan city endowed with great dynamism. A great place with a rich culture, an identity of its own and an inexhaustible cultural and recreational offer. The city is divided in 10 districts and 73 neighbourhoods. In this project, I create a Machine Learning model using a **k-means clustering algorithm** to divide Barcelona into 5 differents zones according to the coordinates of each neighborhood, their principal attractive places, cost of the average rental of apartments, public libraries and transport information. 




#### Technologies used in this project:
* Python
* pandas, numpy
* sklearn, cluster kmeans
* matplotlib, seaborn, folium
* jupyter notebooks, anaconda

## Data

The sources used for this project were:

- **Foursquare**, to get the venue data from the neighbourhoods
- **[Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/es/)**, to get information about:
    - Population
    - Coordinates of the neighbourhoods
    - Apartment rental by neighborhood 
    - Public libraries 
    - Public transportation
