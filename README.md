# The quest for the perfect Neighbourhood

This is the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Project overview

Barcelona is a modern cosmopolitan city endowed with great dynamism. A great place with a rich culture, an identity of its own and an inexhaustible cultural and recreational offer. The city is divided in 10 districts and 73 neighbourhoods. In this project, a machine learning model was created using a **k-means clustering algorithm** to divide Barcelona into 5 differents zones according to the coordinates of each neighborhood, their principal attractive places, cost of the average rental of apartments, public libraries and transport information. 

As part of the project, a [Business approach](https://github.com/HannaLAguilar/The_Battle_of_the_neighborhoods-Barcelona/blob/master/Business%20approach.md) was developed.
